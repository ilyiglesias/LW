Length-weight data for rockfish cruise
This project uses length and weight data collected from organisms on the juvenile rockfish and ecoystem assessment survey for input. 
II then plotted these data using the allometric growth equation in order to estimate the relationship between l and w and create an equation for estimating missing values.
Eventually these data will be used to estimate biomass of certain species from the existing cruise data.
